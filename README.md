# Football Ultimate Team Project

# Project Overview
This application allows users to create and manage their own FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) by building a squad, positioning players according to tactical formations (e.g., 4-3-3, 4-4-2), and customizing their team dynamics. The goal is to provide an interactive and dynamic experience for users to add, modify, and organize players into their ideal lineup while respecting the constraints of different tactical formations.

# Key Features 

Dynamic Player Form: Users can add players to the squad with details such as name, position, rating, and other statistics.

Formation-Based Positioning: The application automatically adjusts player positions according to the selected formation, such as 4-3-3 or 4-4-2, ensuring players are positioned according to tactical rules.

Dynamic Player Management: Users can add, modify, or remove players, with real-time feedback to ensure no more than 11 players are in the main formation. Any additional players will be assigned to the reserves.

LocalStorage for Data Persistence (Bonus): The app stores the team and formation data locally, so users can save their progress and retrieve it when reopening the app.

Responsive Design: The application is optimized for different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
